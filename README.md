# Data Structures & Order Statistics Toolkit (Python)

This repository contains two fully interactive, menu-driven Python tools developed for academic coursework in Algorithms and Data Structures:

---

## 📌 **Part 1 – Order Statistics Selection Tool **  
**File:** `selection_dynamic.py`

This program implements and compares two classic selection algorithms for finding the **k-th smallest element** in an unsorted array:

### ✅ Implemented Algorithms
- **Deterministic Linear-Time Selection** (Median of Medians)
- **Randomized Quickselect**
- **Benchmark Mode** (compares both algorithms + execution time)

### ⭐ Features
- Dynamic multi-line input for numbers  
- Input validation & colorized output  
- Change k anytime  
- Enter new dataset anytime  
- Re-run algorithms repeatedly without restarting  
- Benchmarks with timing comparison  
- Professional CLI menus  
- Ctrl + C safe exit  

---

## 🧰 **Part 2 – Elementary Data Structures Tool (Pro Edition)**  
**File:** `data_structures_tool.py`

Interactive CLI tool for:

- Arrays  
- Stacks  
- Queues  
- Singly Linked Lists  

With insertion, deletion, access, search, display, and colorized menus.
